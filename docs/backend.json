    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the LensVivid application's features, emphasizing security, scalability, and ease of debugging. It incorporates denormalization to ensure authorization independence, avoids `get()` calls in security rules, and adheres to the principle that rules are not filters (QAPs).  \n\n**Authorization Independence:**  Ownership and authorization context are denormalized into subcollections to avoid hierarchical dependencies. For example, `Feedback` includes the `userProfileId` which represents the owner, so security rules do not need to fetch the parent `UserProfile` to validate access.  \n\n**QAPs:**  The structure supports secure `list` operations (QAPs) through structural segregation and path-based ownership. Each collection houses data with a consistent security posture, ensuring that listing operations can be secured effectively without filtering data based on document content. The use of hierarchical paths `/users/{userId}/feedbacks/{feedbackId}` enables the efficient listing of a user's feedback, as well as simplifies security rules. \n\n**User Profiles:** User profiles are stored in a private collection `/users/{userId}`. This ensures that profile data is directly tied to the authenticated user and simplifies security rules for profile access.\n\n**Services:** Services are stored in a root-level collection `/services`.  \n\n**Feedback:** Feedback is nested under the user who created it and the service it refers to at `/users/{userProfileId}/feedbacks/{feedbackId}`. This simplifies securing access to feedback based on user identity."
