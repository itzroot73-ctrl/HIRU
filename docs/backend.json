    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the LensVivid application, focusing on user profiles, photography services, payment cards, purchase tracking, and user feedback. The structure prioritizes security, scalability, and ease of debugging by adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters).\n\n**Authorization Independence (CRITICAL):** Authorization is managed without hierarchical dependencies, avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. User-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring clear ownership. This approach allows for atomic operations (transactions/batches) without relying on parent document data.\n\n**Structural Segregation (Homogeneous Security Posture):** Each collection is designed with a specific security context. User profiles, payment cards, purchases, and feedback are stored in user-specific subcollections to ensure only the authenticated user can access their own data. Photography services are stored in a global collection (`/photographyServices`) as these are intended to be publicly accessible for browsing.\n\n**Access Modeling (Standardization and Consistency):** Path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/...`) is used for private user data. The 1:N relationship between users and their private data is modeled using hierarchical paths. This approach provides clear ownership and simplifies security rules.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n*   The segregation of photography services into a separate collection (`/photographyServices`) allows for secure listing of all available services without exposing any private data.\n*   User-owned data collections are stored in user-specific subcollections, ensuring that users can only list and access their own data."
